# Lexical Implementation Report

## Executive Summary
- Successfully implemented universal CLI architecture
- Multi-agent orchestrator with flexible role assignment
- Workflow engine for configurable task processing
- New MCP tools with backward compatibility

## Implementation Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Universal CLI Wrapper ✅
- Created src/cli/universal-cli.js
- Unified interface for Claude and Gemini
- Role-based execution (plan, execute, review)
- Cache and metrics integration

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Orchestrator ✅
- Created src/orchestrator/multi-agent-orchestrator.js
- Agent registry for managing multiple CLIs
- Parallel execution support
- Auto-selection logic

### Phase 3: Workflow System ✅
- Created src/workflow/workflow-engine.js
- Built-in workflows (direct, plan-execute, competitive, iterative)
- Step execution with context management
- Flow control and retry logic

### Phase 4: MCP Tools Update ✅
- Created src/mcp-servers/universal-mcp-server.js
- New tools: orchestrate, list_workflows, list_agents
- Backward compatibility maintained

### Phase 5: Migration & Cleanup ✅
- Updated package.json
- Cleaned test files
- Updated exports

## Architecture Improvements
- Any CLI can perform any role
- Parallel execution capability
- Workflow-driven task processing
- Improved modularity and extensibility

## Test Results
- UniversalCLI: Working with Gemini
- MultiAgentOrchestrator: Functional
- WorkflowEngine: Fully operational
- Cache and Metrics: Integrated

## Next Steps
- Fine-tune workflow definitions
- Add more built-in workflows
- Performance optimization
- Enhanced error handling

## Conclusion
The Lexical orchestrator has been successfully transformed from a fixed-role system to a flexible, universal architecture where any CLI can perform any role. The implementation maintains backward compatibility while adding powerful new capabilities.
