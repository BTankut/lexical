# Architecture vs. Implementation Analysis Report

This report provides a detailed comparison of the planned architecture as described in the `docs-2/` folder and the actual implementation in the codebase.

## 1. Planned vs. Implemented Features

| Feature | Planned | Implemented | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Universal CLI** | A single `UniversalCLI` class to handle all CLI interactions, with role-based prompts and CLI-specific configurations. | `src/cli/universal-cli.js` exists and is implemented closely to the specification. It supports different CLIs through configurations and uses role-based prompt templates. | ‚úÖ **Completed** |
| **Multi-Agent Orchestrator** | An orchestrator that can manage multiple agents, with an agent registry, agent selection logic, and support for parallel execution. | `src/orchestrator/multi-agent-orchestrator.js` and `src/orchestrator/agent-registry.js` are implemented. The orchestrator can register and use multiple agents. Parallel execution is implemented. | üü° **Partially Completed** |
| **Workflow System** | A configuration-driven workflow system with a `WorkflowEngine` to execute complex, multi-step tasks. Support for built-in and custom workflows. | `src/workflow/workflow-engine.js` is implemented and can execute pre-defined workflows from `config/workflows/built-in.js`. | üü° **Partially Completed** |
| **MCP Tools** | A new set of flexible MCP tools (`orchestrate`, `orchestrate_workflow`, `list_workflows`, etc.) and a new `universal-mcp-server.js`. | `src/mcp-servers/universal-mcp-server.js` exists and registers new tools. Backward compatibility for old tools is maintained. | üü° **Partially Completed** |
| **Migration & Cleanup** | A phased migration from the old architecture to the new one, with a final cleanup phase to remove legacy code. | The project is in a transitional state. New components have been added, but legacy files like `planner.js` and `executor.js` are still present. | ‚è≥ **In Progress** |

## 2. Missing or Incomplete Components

### Multi-Agent Orchestrator
*   **Agent Selection Logic:** The `selectBestAgent` method in `agent-registry.js` is very basic. It only performs a simple capability match. The planned scoring mechanism based on role, language, and context size is not implemented.
*   **Auto-Selection (`executeAuto`):** The `executeAuto` method in `multi-agent-orchestrator.js` is a placeholder and simply uses the default agent. The logic to analyze prompt requirements and select the best agent is missing.

### Workflow System
*   **Advanced Workflow Features:** The `WorkflowEngine` only supports basic sequential step execution. The following planned features are missing:
    *   Conditional execution of steps (`condition` property).
    *   Flow control (`onSuccess`, `onFailure`).
    *   Step-level validation (`validate` property).
    *   A `WorkflowBuilder` for dynamic workflow creation.
    *   A `WorkflowSelector` for automatic workflow selection based on rules.

### MCP Tools
*   **Tool Implementation:** The handlers for the new MCP tools in `universal-mcp-server.js` are mostly placeholders.
    *   `handleOrchestrate` returns a hardcoded success message and is not integrated with the `MultiAgentOrchestrator`.
    *   `handleListWorkflows` and `handleListAgents` return hardcoded data.
    *   The more advanced tools specified in the documentation, such as `orchestrate_workflow`, `orchestrate_parallel`, and `get_capabilities`, are not implemented at all.

## 3. Implementation Quality and Adherence to Specifications

*   **Universal CLI:** The implementation of the `UniversalCLI` is of high quality and adheres very closely to the design document. The code is well-structured and follows the specified patterns.
*   **Multi-Agent Orchestrator:** The basic structure is in place, but the implementation lacks the planned sophistication in agent selection. The code is clean but incomplete.
*   **Workflow System:** The `WorkflowEngine` provides a good foundation, but it's missing most of the advanced features that would make it truly powerful and flexible as per the specification.
*   **MCP Tools:** The `universal-mcp-server.js` is more of a scaffold than a functional implementation. The tool handlers need to be properly implemented and integrated with the rest of the new architecture.
*   **Code Conventions:** The code is generally well-written and follows consistent conventions.

## 4. Overall Completion Percentage

Based on the analysis of the implemented features against the roadmap, the overall completion percentage is estimated to be around **50%**.

*   Phase 1 (Universal CLI): ~95%
*   Phase 2 (Multi-Agent Support): ~60%
*   Phase 3 (Workflow System): ~40%
*   Phase 4 (MCP Tools Update): ~30%
*   Phase 5 (Migration & Cleanup): ~20%

## 5. Priority Recommendations for Missing Components

1.  **High Priority - Complete MCP Tool Implementation:** The `universal-mcp-server.js` is the main entry point for interacting with the system. The tool handlers should be fully implemented and integrated with the `MultiAgentOrchestrator` and `WorkflowEngine`. This will make the new architecture usable.
2.  **High Priority - Implement Advanced Agent Selection:** The core value of the multi-agent orchestrator is its ability to intelligently select the best agent for a task. The sophisticated scoring and selection logic from the design document should be implemented in `agent-registry.js` and `multi-agent-orchestrator.js`.
3.  **Medium Priority - Implement Advanced Workflow Features:** To enable the full power of the workflow system, the missing features like conditional execution, flow control, and validation should be added to the `WorkflowEngine`.
4.  **Medium Priority - Implement `WorkflowSelector`:** An automatic workflow selection mechanism will greatly improve the usability of the system.
5.  **Low Priority - Implement `WorkflowBuilder`:** While useful, a dynamic workflow builder is less critical than the other missing components for the core functionality of the system.
6.  **Low Priority - Finalize Migration and Cleanup:** Once all the new features are implemented and tested, the legacy code can be removed and the migration can be completed.
