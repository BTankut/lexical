# Gemini Context File

## Session Information
- Project: Lexical-TUI-Claude
- Purpose: Multi-agent orchestrator with universal CLI architecture
- Current Session: Testing session persistence

## Today's Work Summary
1. Created UniversalCLI wrapper (src/cli/universal-cli.js)
2. Created MultiAgentOrchestrator (src/orchestrator/multi-agent-orchestrator.js)
3. Created WorkflowEngine (src/workflow/workflow-engine.js)
4. Created HealthCheck system (src/utils/health-check.js)
5. Created ProgressReporter (src/utils/progress-reporter.js)
6. Created SessionManager (src/utils/session-manager.js)

## Important Context
- Every CLI can perform any role (plan, execute, review)
- MCP server communication needs session management
- Timeout increased to 5 minutes
- Retry logic with exponential backoff implemented
- Streaming output support added

## Current Issues
- MCP calls create new sessions each time
- Need to maintain context between calls
- Gemini doesn't have --continue flag like Claude

## Next Steps
- Test session persistence methods
- Implement context injection in MCP calls
- Create batch operation support
